                        In 1863, five years after immigrating to the United States from Torreta, a small town outside Palermo Italy, Pieril Pierilini brought the art of Italian pastry making to the internet, now this is what you get, Pieril Pierilini on the interwet. Finally you can order pie from your bedroom.

                <p class="ml-4 mr-4">
                        Pierils’s motto is: “If its not good enough for me, its not good enough for my customers” and therefore prides himself on using only the highest quality ingredients. Pieril's products are all made from scratch on premises and have no preservative and no trans fat.

                       There is only one Pierilini Pieril. <br>
                       At the age of 18, with no formal training, he started out washing dishes at his own bakery and began learning the art of baking from authentic old world pastry chefs and bakers from Italy.
                       Pieril started the pie company from nothing and is still to this day our director of taste.

                        Anotonia was also there from the begining, she was there when the only filling available was cabbage. Now there is no more cabbage, only the best ingredients. No cabbage = No worries. Antonie is our trusted anti cabbage ambassador.  <br>

                        Roberto is our youngest employee but his age does not reflect his wide skillset. Roberto revamped our online-order system and allowed us to increase or total orders by 600%. 
                        <br>
                        Robert got fired but his code still lives on. And that's why his picture is still here on this wall.

                        Alessandro is our dough master for 12 years. After a somewhat successful boxing career, Allesandro was invited to work in his family company. <br> Without Allé, we would not have the firmness in our pies as we do today. His hands are our hands, and that's why we are proud to present him as our dough master.

                        Being the only person in Italy with this name, he's fur sure a rarity.
                        Not to be confused by his more successful cousin Armani, Armano upholds the title managing of hygiene, but he also works with making sure all orders go through our system without any hassle. 
                        <br>Adriano is a problem solver, that's why he works for Pieril. Enemies need solving.  <br>
